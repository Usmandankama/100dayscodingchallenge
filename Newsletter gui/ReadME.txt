Before running the program

Import or install Beautifulsoup or bs4
Import or install requests module too
You should also have your pc connected to the internet or the program will prompt you to do that

To be able to login as Admin, you have to manually input your details to "Authorised.json".
If users.json file is empty the program will send mail to nobody.

if yu want to otherwise send mails from your email account instead, you can go to
    line 9 in Main_.py and tweak the variables

That's not my real password BTW incase you are wondering


You can use "Return key" to submit,change focus between input fields and login as well
That's pretty much it...enjoy

Put in mind this is not a finished project...
